# Todo-List

This Etch-A-Sketch is a Web-App where you can unleash your creativity & imagination and express it to the board. This web-app is a virtual representation of the real life etch-a-sketch toy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML CSS/SASS/SCSS JS REACT TYPESCRIPT

HTML
CSS
JS

SASS/SCSS: I learned about sass/scss nesting where styling can be passed down from the parent down to its children and those outside will not be included. I also learned about "&__" where each consecutive nesting becomes easier since I mainly use BEM CSS naming convetion and therefore not have to type its parent block makes it easier to style. There's also loops as well as variable declaration in sass/scss and different ways of importing/exporting modules.

React: I learned about useState where you can manage how and what components to render based on the value of the state. UseEffect which I mostly use to monitor values that is/are required to re-render upon detection of changes like LocalStorage for serialization & deserialization. UseRef and the idea behind react or how to think "in-react.js" and that's about how most of the states are on top like a spider web to manage the states & values. However, compared to JavaScript I find that react.js is limited or rather strict but it also allows for easier development as most of the low-code logic are abstracted thus making creation faster.

## Optimizations:

The design can be enhanced further to make it more alluring and modern. Functionalities that you like can be added like more control on the colors or adding an eraser.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned about DOM manipulations where you change/add/remove the properties of HTML & CSS indirectly just through JavaScript. Using addEventListeners & selecting HTML elements through their IDs to change how they behave is very fascinating and insightful/eye-opening to me.
